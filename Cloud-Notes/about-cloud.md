## How we have used the cloud
* storage e.g. onedrive
* access virtual machine
 
## Questions we have

## What is cloud computing?
* on-demand delivery of computing power, storage, applications or other IT resources
* Usually has pay-as-you-go pricing
* You can access many resources, almost instantly
* Cloud provider usually own and maintain the network & hardware & to varying degrees the software & security

## 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud
 
* Public cloud
  * also called "multi-tenant"
  * owned & operated by a 3rd party cloud service provider
  * available to anyone over the internet
  * shared with the public
* Private cloud
  * also called "single-tenant cloud"
  * cloud infrastructure dedicated to a private organisation
    * could by owned by the organisation
    * could be hosted 3rd party organisation
  * could be used when there's no internet access (e.g. on a cruise ship
  * advantages
    * complete control
    * security for sensitive apps/data
* Hybrid cloud
* Multi-cloud
