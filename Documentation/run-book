# Run Book

walkthrough of how to recreate an app deployment

Before you start you will need access to an AWS EC2 instance, this is what we will be using to create the app and database.

# step 1 - Setting up your AWS Key

in order to be able to create a working instance you first need to get your hands on a AWS key- 
The key is used to gain access into our virtual machines later.

1. Once logged into your AWS account in the search bar in the top left type "Key pairs" this could then bring up a EC2 feature, 
2. when you have clicked on that it will bring up a page full of key pairs if their isn't any yet we can just make one. 
3. in order to do so click the Create key pair in the top right corner: 
4. Entering an appropriate name something like "Group-Name-AWS" you want to make sure you have the RSA key pair type selected and make sure the private key format is .pem ( this will allow us to SSH into the VM later)
5. Once you have clicked create a Public key will be attached onto the AWS page and a Private key will be downloaded onto your device. (Never reveal your private key to anyone)

# step 2 - Storing your Private Key safely

When working with private keys its important to store them in a safe location that you wont ever release onto something like GITHUB, 
A typical location to put your .pem key is within your Home Directory on your computer. 

An example of how to get to your home directory is as follows: 
"C/Users/pc-name/" Once on your HD ( Home directory) create a folder called .ssh this is where we will be storing our private pem key.
> DO NOT under any circumstances Git Init this file or any Parent folder of it
Once the key is store its time to create your first instance

# step 3 - Creating your DB (Data Base) Instance
1. Back on AWS there should be a list on the left hand side when you are on EC2, if there is not click the blue circle with the 3 lines in the middle.
On the list there should be an option called instances if so click on it.

2. This should then bring up a list of all the instanced created by you or your organization if there is none worry not, we will make one.
3. In the top left corner click ""Launch Instance" 
That will then take you onto a page asking you to fill out information and select and application and OS image, 

4. The first thing you want to do is to name your image appropriately something like "group-name-db-to-run",or "group-name-app-to-run" once you have named it you need to select a OS Image, for this guide we will be Using "Ubuntu".
5. Click on the Ubuntu quick start and just below on the AMI tap click the drop down box just below it and select "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM) SSD Volume type" This should be a free tier image.

6. Once selected scroll down to Instance type clicking the drop down arrow inside the box type/select "t3.micro" when selected the all generations slider should be ticked which is good.
7. once completed you can move on to adding your key pair you just created in the Key Pair Login box just below, For this you can just search for it with the group-name you made earlier.

### Network Settings for db

With all of this completed we need to sort out the  DB Network Settings:

You should have two inbound rules the first is the SSH port range 22
and the other is the Custom TCP 27017

1. You can add this by clicking the edit button in the top right corner if the network settings box, Be sure to rename the security group to something appropriate like ["group-name-allow-ssh-mongodb"]() and just copy and paste the name into the description as well. 

2. To add the port 27017 we need to click the Add security group rule button which will allow us to then put 27017 into the port range box and then you're done.

3. You can now click "Launch Instance on the right hand side of the screen (An orange button)

### Network Settings for App

1. For the app instance you will need to have 3 different inbound rules
port 80, Can be added by clicking the "Allow HTTP traffic from internet before clicking edit on the network settings. 

>port 3000, - Used later when making our app link to pages.
port 22,- default port

2. You can add this by clicking the edit button in the top right corner if the network settings box, Be sure to rename the security group to something appropriate like "group-name-allow-ssh-http" and just copy and paste the name into the description as well. 

3. To add the port 3000 we need to click the Add security group rule button which will allow us to then put 3000 into the port range box and then you're done.

4. You can now click "Launch Instance on the right hand side of the screen (An orange button)

# DB Script walkthrough  

["Script for DataBase"](/AWS/prov.db2.sh)

My script now: 
```
#!/bin/bash
#update and upgrade
sudo apt update
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -y

#install gpg for mongo db
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg \
   --dearmor --yes

#create mongodb list
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list

sudo  apt-get update

#sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
   mongodb-org=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-database=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-server=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-mongosh \
   mongodb-org-shell=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-mongos=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-tools=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-database-tools-extra=7.0.24


sudo sed -i 's/bindIp: .*/bindIp: 0.0.0.0/' /etc/mongod.conf

sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod 
```
# Here are some problem I encountered while making:

##### Mongod wasn't starting when script was running
###### The reason for is :
* Before:
> sudo sed -i "s/^  bindIp: .*/  bindIp: 0.0.0.0/" /etc/mongod.conf

* After: 
> sudo sed -i 's/bindIp: .*/bindIp: 0.0.0.0/' /etc/mongod.conf
* Other changes done to fix issues include:
 I changed the "" into '' instead and I also had to remove the ^ symbol. in the config file for mongod the spacing/syntax was all wrong and not the correct format that a YAML file needed to run/work therefore causing it to crash. due to this I had to fix the spacing and syntax and remove some symbols fixing the overall DB issues.
--------------------------------------------
 # Break down of the scripts 

#### The first few lines 

This lets the console know we are wanting to use a Bash terminal
> #!/bin/bash - 

This is a good thing to run when you first start a fresh VM as it makes sure everything is updated to latest version.
> sudo apt update - 

This is also something you may want to run at the start as it will upgrade everything 

> sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -y - 

DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive - this tell the computer when running that we don't want any user interface 

-y - this simply just tells the computer that we say yes to everything that may come up. 

#### Getting our installs ready

> #installing gpg for mongo db to work
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | \
   sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg \
   --dearmor --yes


> #creating a list for mongodb
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list


sudo  apt-get update - getting the update for the mongodb

#### Installing MongoDB 

following from the mongodb installation guide on their website we install version 7, and we make sure theirs no UI 

> #sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y mongodb-org
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
   mongodb-org=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-database=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-server=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-mongosh \
   mongodb-org-shell=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-mongos=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-tools=7.0.24 \
   mongodb-org-database-tools-extra=7.0.24


#### Replacing the Bind Ip in the config files

this is an automated way to replace whatever the bind ip is when mongodp start and swaps it with 0.0.0.0 we do this by using the SED command.

> sudo sed -i 's/bindIp: .*/bindIp: 0.0.0.0/' /etc/mongod.conf 


we then start mongodb and enable it 
> sudo systemctl start mongod
> sudo systemctl enable mongod 

------------------------------------------------

 # App Script walkthrough  

["Script for App](/AWS/prov.app2.sh)
 Current App Script:

This section is same for most script and as described above
 > #!/bin/bash
echo update start
sudo apt update

> echo upgrade start
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -y

This installs NginX so that the webpage works
> echo nginx install
sudo  DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install nginx -y

### replacing the lines in the nginx default to a proxy pass of 3000

> sudo sed -i 's|try_files \$uri \$uri/ =404;|proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;|' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
sudo systemctl restart nginx

### Getting node off the web and downloading it 
> curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
> sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive bash nodesource_setup.sh
> sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install nodejs -y

### cloning the github repo with the app files in it into a file called repo
> git clone https://github.com/OlliKm/tech515_sparta_app_to_clone.git repo 
cd repo/app

### connecting db-hosts to a variable for mongodb and putting in DB priv ip and local host to allow for us to access /posts
> export DB_HOST=mongodb://172.31.25.55:27017/posts
> printenv DB_HOST

### now we have nodejs installed we can now install
> npm install

### installing pm2 to run app in background
> sudo npm install -g pm2

### stoping any running jobs then start to make sure its fresh and the port isn't occupied. 
> pm2 stop all
> pm2 start app.js

--------------------------------------

> # In the User Data Section 
This script I had the most problem with getting working, things such as PM2 not starting properly whenever I ran the script to fix this I had to create a separate run script to put in the user data section of the instance on AWS. 

#### change the IP to match the DB priv IP
export DB_HOST=mongodb://DB-PRIV-IP:27017/posts
printenv DB_HOST

#### stop all pm2 jobs running
pm2 stop all

#run a new fresh pm2 job
pm2 start app.js

--------------------------------------------

This fixed that issue but then i had another issue where I could get the app home page working with the reverse proxy working but whenever I tried to add the /posts into the url of web i got an error message of "{}" to fix this I experimented with many things such as syntaxes moving parts of the script around and adding the :27017 part to the posts section but what fixed my posts page was going into my App instance on AWS and adding the Network Setting of adding Port 3000, as the reverse proxy skipped the port 3000 tunnel meaning I didn't experience it until I when onto the posts page which needed to use the port 3000 to run the posts.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

03/12/2025 - experienced issues with the app script not bringing up the posts page correctly things I've changed 

in the DB I swapped the .* i had to the (bindIp: 127.0.0.1) to sort any faults that may of occurred from it. 

* for the App I have [App Script](/AWS/prov.app2.sh) as my working script I had to restart the aws instance delete / remove the repo folder from previous attempts and then run the sh file prov.app2.sh which when the ip was correct in the export the posts page worked.

# Creating a Launch template

> Launch template photo
![alt text](/Images/image.png)
> Launch template photo

**A launch template is a set of already configured files that will be use to clone and replicate AMI instances**

1. click on the Launch Template Tab on the instances bar, once selected click create launch template in the top right corner
2. Name your launch instance something like **"tech515-oliver-for-asg-app-lt"**
3. attach your previously made AMI Image onto the applications and OS Images section under the "My AMI's"
4. in the instance type selection box below select the t3.micro option
5. Connect your AWS Key Pair to the "key pair (login) tab so you can access the VM's
6. Within the Network settings chose an already existing security group and select the relevant one whether its for the app **"tech-515-oliver-allow-ssh-http"** or the DB **"tech515-oliver-allow-ssh-mongodb"**
7. If you are making the App launch template make sure to include your Run script in the User Data sections at the bottom.

Once you have your Launch Template created you can now make your new Auto Scaling Group


* once complete click the next button in bottom right to move to the next page
------------------------------------------------- 
# Creating an auto scaling group 
* To learn more about auto scaling and its uses click link below
[learn-more-about-auto-scaling-and-monitoring](/other/monitoring-alarms-autoscaling.md)

#### Accessing the Auto Scaling Group Tab
* Step 1
  ![alt text](/Images/image-9.png)
  First click on the Auto Scaling Groups option on the EC2 AWS bar on the left - it should be the last option on the list.


--------------------------------------------- 
* Step 2
> Availability Zones & Subnets
![alt text](/Images/image-1.png)
> Availability Zones & Subnets

For the next page we will need to leave the vpc as default and configure the Availability zones and subnets we will be using
We will need 3 subnets:
*  A
*  B
*  C
we will be looking for the EU-WEST1 for each of these 
at this moment in time we will be using: 

This will be our Zone A subnet
> euw1-az3 (eu-west-1a) | subnet-0429d69d55dfad9d2 (default-subnet-eu-west-1a)

This will be our Zone B subnet
> euw1-az1 (eu-west-1b) | subnet-0e9b6138ff1ce18f2 (DevOpsStudentSubnet)

And This will be our Zone C subnet
> euw1-az2 (eu-west-1c) | subnet-013b0b0deea20b0e5 (default-subnet-eu-west-1c)

Once those have been added to your subnet we want to leave the "Availability Zone Distribution" to the default - "Balance Best Effort"
* once complete click the next button in bottom right to move to the next page
----------------------------------------------------- 
* Step 3
  * This one may be confusing as there is a lot to configure 
### Part A
> part A photo
![alt text](/Images/image-2.png)
> part A photo

Within the first section of step 3 of creation we need to select our load balancing for this we will pick "Attach to a new load balancer" as we haven't got one created
* be sure to name your load balancer I recommend adding "lb" to the end instead of 1 thats default
* we also need to make sure we select Internet Facing as this will allow input from HTTP and HTTPS (The Web)
### Part B
> part B photo
![alt text](/Images/image-3.png)
> part B photo
> 
This part is simple you just want to click when it says default routing and then select create a target group
* this should then  prompt us to name it so following naming conventions something like **"tech515-oliver-asg-app-lb-tg"**
  
### Part C
> part C photo
![alt text](/Images/image-4.png)
> part C photo

For this part of the page we are wanting to enable the "Additional health check types:
 - [x] Turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks" 
2. * then configure the Health check grace period to 180 seconds (3 mins) to allow time for the app to load up without the system flagging it as unhealthy 

### Part D
> part D photo
![alt text](/Images/image-5.png)
> part D photo

1. for this next page we are configuring how many VM's we want running- 
for this we will set the Desired Capacity to 2 running machines 
with the minium of 2 in case 1 crashes this insure there will always be one running and set the max capacity to 3 in case the expected capacity is reached
* for automatic scaling - set that to Target tracking scaling policy and move to step 5

  
### Part E
> part E photo
![alt text](/Images/image-7.png)
> part E photo

For this step we are simply changing the instance warm up to **180** seconds and making sure we stay on "Average CPU Usage"
1. * once complete click next on the page
  
2. * Ignore everything below the instance warm up and just click next to move to next page
----------------------------------- 
* step 5
  Just ignore the notification page just and click **Next**

  -----------------------------------------------------

* step 6
> tags photo
![alt text](/Images/image-8.png)
> tags photo

1. * For this page we are wanting to add a tag under the key section we want to add "Name" and under the value we want to put what our instances will be called something like **"tech515-oliver-asg-HA-SC2"**
2. * Once this has been completed click next 
------------------------------------------- 
* Review Page
  * This should bring up a review page if all the detail are correct click the "Create Auto Scaling Group" button in the bottom right
---------------------------------------

# how to remove the auto scaling room 

**What to delete first**
1. Delete load balancer
2. Target groups
3. Auto scaling groups (asg)
